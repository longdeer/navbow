class Navanalyzer:

	"""
		Navtex messages analyzer.
		Implements the tecnique, that reads text file, splits by whitespaces it's content to chunks,
		and compares chunks against Bag of Word - special container with state determined words.
		Not all chunks will form a "word", so analyzer will first try to filter out following chunks:
			- coordinates;
			- numbers;
			- alphabetic numbers.
		This filtering will rely on regular expression matching, so any totally unmatched chunk will be
		considered a "word" candidate. Such candidates will be then compared with Bag of Word content.
		This is suggestion for Navtex messages processing, which general purpose is filtering out
		determined information and attract attention to probably controversial moments.
		Messages processing will comply "NAVTEX MANUAL" by IMO, which determines following structure:

			but "with_mapping" due zero "state" will try to return dictionary with "message" key, which
			is not present in "sanit_state" return value, so it will be None. All unknown words will be
			mapped in "BoW" with 0, so "BoW" will be eventually altered. "BoW" will be checked to be a
			Mapping type, but very easy. If "BoW" is not a mapping, "analysis" will have empty "unknown"
			and "known" dictionaries, and "state" will reflect it in 65-71 range. Return value is a
			dictionary, which might be of two types:
				state, message - for the "corrupted" files;
				state, analysis, raw, air - all other cases.
