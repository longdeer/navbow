ISSUED BY THE MET OFFICE ON BEHALF OF THE MARITIME AND COASTGUARD AGENCY
AT 142300 UTC
AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE 1007 ACROSS SERN SWEDEN EXTENDS A SHALLOW TROUGH
WWARDS INTO THE EERN N SEA THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT BUT AWAY FM THIS ANTICYCLONIC
CONDITIONS ARE EXP TO DOMINATE BRINGING A SLACK AIRFLOW CROSS MUCH OF CULLERCOATS.
THE LOW DRIFTS E THROUGH EARLY FRIDAY WHICH ALLOWS HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS NERN
SCANDINAVIA TO INTSF AND AMPLIFY A RIDGE SW ACROSS NORWAY. AT THE SAME TIME
ATLANTIC LOW PRESSURE EDGES E ACROSS THE BRITISH ISLES AND EXTENDS ITS INFLUENCE
ACROSS NERN AND WERN CULLERCOATS. THIS LEADS TO A TIGHTENING PRESSURE PATTERN
ACROSS THE NERN N SEA WITH SWATHES OF STRG TO NEAR GALE FORCE WINDS DEVELOPING
FM LATER FRIDAY. A WKN FRONTAL TROUGH WILL TRACK E ACROSS THE BRITISH ISLES
AND INTO WERN CULLERCOATS ON SATURDAY AFTER WHICH CONFIDENCE IN THE FCST
FALLS. THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO FOR SUNDAY IS FOR THE SCANDINAVIA RIDGE TO
REAMPLIFY INTO THE N SEA WHICH CYCLONIC CONDITIONS AFFECT THE CHANNEL AND
SERN UK
