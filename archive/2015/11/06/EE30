ZCZC EE30
EXTENDED OUTLOOK
SATURDAY TO TUESDAY
ISSUED BY THE MET OFFICE ON BEHALF OF THE COASTGUARD AND
MARITIME AGENCY AT 052300 UTC
THROUGHOUT THE FCST PERIOD HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN SLOW
MOV OVER CONTINENTAL EUROPE WITH LOW PRESSURE DOMINANT
OVER MUCH OF THE N ATLANTIC OCEAN. BETWEEN THESE TWO MAIN
FEATURES WE HAVE A BROAD REGION OF SW WINDS WITHIN WHICH
SMALLER SCALE LOW PRESSURE AREAS ARE LIKELY TO DEVELOP
AND RUN QCKY N EWARDS TOWARDS THE N OF THE BRITISH ISLES.
ONE SUCH LOW IS FCST TO TRACK BETWEEN SCOTLAND AND THE
FAEROE ISLANDS DURING SUNDAY WITH ANOTHER LIKELY TO
FOLLOW A SIMILAR PATH ON TUESDAY. SERN PARTS OF BISCAY
AND FITZROY ARE LIKELY TO ESCAPE STRG WINDS FOR MUCH OF
THE PERIOD. HOWEVER AREAS TO THE N IN PARTICULAR SOLE
FASTNET AND SHANNON ARE EXP TO BE AFFECTED BY STRG WINDS
FOR MOST OF THE PERIOD. AS THE SMALLER SCALE LOWS TRACK
THROUGH WINDS IN THESE AREAS COULD REACH GALE FORCE ON
SUNDAY THEN AGAIN ON TUESDAY
