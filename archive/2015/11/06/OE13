ZCZC OE13
EXTENDED OUTLOOK
SATURDAY TO TUESDAY
ISSUED BY THE MET OFFICE ON BEHALF OF THE COASTGUARD AND
MARITIME AGENCY AT 052300 UTC
THROUGHOUT THE FCST PERIOD HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN SLOW
MOV OVER CONTINENTAL EUROPE WITH LOW PRESSURE DOMINANT
OVER MUCH OF THE N ATLANTIC OCEAN. BETWEEN THESE TWO MAIN
FEATURES WE HAVE A BROAD REGION OF SW WINDS WITHIN WHICH
SMALLER SCALE LOW PRESSURE AREAS ARE LIKELY TO DEVELOP
AND RUN QCKY N EWARDS TOWARDS THE N OF THE BRITISH ISLES.
ONE SUCH LOW IS FCST TO TRACK BETWEEN SCOTLAND AND THE
FAEROE ISLANDS DURING SUNDAY WITH ANOTHER LIKELY TO
FOLLOW A SIMILAR PATH DURING THE COURSE OF TUESDAY. WITH
THIS SET UP PORTPATRICK IS LIKELY TO SEE STRG TO GALE
FORCE WINDS AFFECTING MUCH OF THE AREA THROUGHOUT THE
PERIOD. AS THE SMALLER LOWS TRACK THROUGH WINDS ON THEIR
SERN FLANK COULD INCREASE TO SEV GALE FORCE THOUGH AS
THESE FEATURES WILL BE FAST MOV THESE INCREASES SHOULD BE
BRIEF
