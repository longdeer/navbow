EXTENDED OUTLOOK
FRIDAY TO MONDAY
ISSUEOQBDNBDOFFICE, ON BEHALF OF THE COASTGUARD AND
MARITIME AGENCY, AT 302300 UTC
THE WEATHER OF NWERN EUROPE AND THE SURROUNDING SEAS IS
LIKELY TO BE DOMINATED BY LOW PRESSURE THROUGHOUT. FOR
MUCH OF THE PERIOD A SLOW MOV LOW WILL BE LOCATED BETWEEN
ICELAND AND SCANDINAVIA. AT THE START OF THE PERIOD THE
DOMINANT LOW, AROUND PVN WILL BE LOCATED OVER THE SW
BRITISH ISLES. THIS IS EXP TO TRACK INTO THE N SEA THEN
ON INTO SCANDINAVIA BY SATURDAY EVENING. A SECOND, DPN
LOW IS EXP TO FOLLOW A SIMILAR TRACK DURING SUNDAY,
FOLLOWED BY A THIRD, LESS INTENSE SYSTEM ON MONDAY. STRG,
POSSIBLY GALE FORCE WINDS ARE LIKELY TO AFFECT MUCH OF
THE PORTPATRICK AREA THROUGHOUT THE FCST PERIOD. PERHAPS
MOST NOTABLY DURIATURDAY AS THE SECOND LOW TRACKS
EWARDS ACROSS THE S OF THE AREA, WWITH ITS CENTRAL
PRESSURE FALLING TO AROUND 985, WHEN WINDS TO THE REAR OF
THIS SYSTEM COULD STRENGTHEN TO SEV GALE FORCE FOR A TIME
