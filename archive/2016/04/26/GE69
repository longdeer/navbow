ISSUED BY THE MET OFFICE ON BEHALF OF THE MARITIME AND
COASTGUARD AGENCY AT 252300 UTC
THROUGH THE EARLY PART OF THE FCST PERIOD LOW PRESSURE
WILL DOMINATE THE BRITISH ISLES AND SURROUNDING WATERS.
AT THE SAME TIME A LARGE HIGH WILL BE SLOW MOV IN THE
CENTRAL N ATLANTIC. THIS SET UP WILL PERSIST THROUGH
THURSDAY. HOWEVER BY THE TIME WE GET TO FRIDAY THE HIGH
WILL FINALLY BEGIN TO WITHDRAW SWARDS AND BY SATURDAY IT
WILL LIE BETWEEN THE AZORES AND THE IBERIAN PENINSULA.
THIS WILL ALLOW A RETURN OF THE MORE USUAL EWARD PROGRESS
OF LOW PRESSURE SYSTEMS ACROSS THE N ATLANTIC BY THE END
OF THE PERIOD. ALTHOUGH LOW PRESSURE DOMINATES MUCH OF
THE PERIOD WIND ACROSS CULLERCOATS ARE NEVER ESPECIALLY
STRG. HOWEVER LATE THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY STRG WINDS COULD
DEVELOP ACROSS CENTRAL AND SERN PARTS IF A SMALL LOW
FORMS ACROSS SERN BRITAIN THOUGH CONFIDENCE AT THIS
STAGE IN THIS FEATURE REMAINS LOW
